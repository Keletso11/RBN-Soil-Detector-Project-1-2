# RBN-Soil-Detector-Project-1-2_GK
First project of coding and building a soil detector.

This repository contains the files and resources for a Soil Moisture Detector project.
The device helps monitor soil conditions by measuring moisture, temperature, humidity, and light levels, making it useful for gardening, farming, and educational purposes.

 # Features
* Detects soil moisture percentage with LED indicators:
  * Green → Moisture at 50%
  * Yellow → Moisture at 30%
  * Flashing Red → Moisture at 10%
* Displays Temperature, Humidity, and Light readings on an LCD screen.
* Powered by Arduino

# Hardware Requirements

* Arduino UNO
* Soil moisture sensor
* DHT11 / DHT22 sensor (for temperature & humidity)
* Light sensor (LDR)
* LCD display (16x2 or similar)
* LEDs (Red, Yellow, Green)
* Resistors, jumper wires, breadboard
